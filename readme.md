Uno game = "Șeptică" with some special cards

The aim of the game is to be the first player who finish the cards(in my version).
The deck consists of 100 cards: four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four," and 23 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of "Skip," "Draw Two." These four types are known as "action cards."

"Wild Draw Four" - take 4 cards
    - can be added over the same color if is not the same value
    -when is the first card in the game, the player can put any card over and he don't have to take 4 cards

"Draw Two" - take 2 cards
    -the player can add over a card with the same color

"Skip" - next player is stopped
    -the curent player can add just a skip card if he has, if not nextPlayer plays and the curent player is stopped
    -next player can add sameValue or sameColor

"Wild" - add any card 
    - can be added over the same color

To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile.
